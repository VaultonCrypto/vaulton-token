> **The Zero-Fee Token That Burns Itself**

Vaulton is a revolutionary BSC token engineered for institutional adoption through hardcoded smart contract security and progressive, transparent scarcity. Each sell triggers a 2% mechanism that accumulates BNB for automated buyback and burn cycles—creating mathematical buying pressure without any transaction fees.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🆓 Zero Transaction Fees**: No taxes ever—true deflation without taxing holders
- **🔥 Auto-Deflation**: Automated buyback and burn mechanism
- **🏛️ Institutional Security**: 85% of tokens locked, reserved, or in automated systems
- **👥 Community-First**: 93.2% of tokens reserved for the community
- **🔒 Immutable Rules**: Hardcoded rules that cannot be changed after deployment
- **📈 Price Support**: 45.5% of supply dedicated to buyback reserves

## 📊 Tokenomics (V2)

- **Total Supply**: 22,000,000 VAULTON
- **Buyback Reserve**: 10,000,000 tokens (45.5%)
- **Presale**: 4,500,000 tokens (20.5%)
- **Liquidity**: 2,180,250 tokens (9.9%)
- **CEX Reserves**: 3,820,000 tokens (17.4%)
- **Team**: 1,500,000 tokens (6.8%)
- **Auto-Sell Trigger**: 2% of each sell transaction
- **Buyback Threshold**: 0.03 BNB

## 🛠️ Smart Contract

The Vaulton smart contract implements a unique deflationary mechanism:

1. **Auto-Sell**: 2% of tokens auto-sold on each transaction
2. **BNB Accumulation**: Converted tokens accumulate as BNB
3. **Automated Buyback**: When threshold reached, BNB buys tokens
4. **Permanent Burn**: Bought tokens sent to dead address
5. **Progressive Scarcity**: Supply decreases, price support increases

### Contract Features

- **ERC20 Compliant**: Standard token functions
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Secure against attacks
- **Owner Functions**: Limited to setup only
- **Immutable Core**: Mechanism cannot be modified
- **Gas Optimized**: Efficient execution

## 🔍 Static Analysis

### Slither Security Analysis

The Vaulton smart contract has been analyzed using Slither, a static analysis framework for Solidity. The analysis identified controlled findings that are addressed through our security architecture:

#### Identified Patterns
- **Reentrancy Warnings**: Detected in DEX interaction functions (`_progressiveSellForBNB`, `_triggerBuybackAndBurn`)
- **External Calls**: PancakeSwap router interactions for token swaps
- **State Changes**: Post-call variable updates for tracking accumulated BNB and burn statistics

#### Security Mitigations
- **OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard**: All critical functions protected against reentrancy attacks
- **Controlled External Calls**: Only trusted PancakeSwap router interactions
- **State Isolation**: Critical state changes occur in protected contexts
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Swap failures don't affect core token functionality

#### Analysis Summary
```
✅ No critical vulnerabilities detected
✅ Reentrancy protection properly implemented
✅ External call patterns follow best practices
⚠️  Controlled findings documented and mitigated
```

**Note**: The detected patterns are standard for DEX-integrated tokens and are properly secured through OpenZeppelin's battle-tested ReentrancyGuard implementation.
