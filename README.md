> **The Zero-Fee Token That Burns Itself**

Vaulton is a revolutionary BSC token engineered for institutional adoption through hardcoded smart contract security and progressive, transparent scarcity. Each sell triggers a 2% mechanism that accumulates BNB for automated buyback and burn cycles - creating mathematical buying pressure without any transaction fees.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🆓 Zero Transaction Fees**: No taxes ever - true deflation without taxing holders
- **🔥 Auto-Deflation**: Automated buyback and burn mechanism
- **🏛️ Institutional Security**: 85% of tokens locked, burned, or in automated systems
- **👥 Community-First**: 95% of tokens reserved for the community
- **🔒 Immutable Rules**: Hardcoded rules that cannot be changed after deployment

## 🛠️ Smart Contract

The Vaulton smart contract implements a unique deflationary mechanism:

2. **BNB Accumulation**: Converted tokens accumulate as BNB
3. **Automated Buyback**: When threshold reached, BNB buys tokens
4. **Permanent Burn**: Bought tokens sent to dead address
5. **Progressive Scarcity**: Supply decreases, price support increases
